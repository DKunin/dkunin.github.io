    <p>The only balanced dice are Vegas dice. Those are made in hermetically sealed chambers to stop any air from getting into the dice. However even under these conditions Vegas dice are still swapped every 15-20 minutes because rolling conditions such as the felted tables can cause the dice to consistently roll a number.</p>

<p>Any dice not made in a hermetically sealed chamber will have some amount of air inside, and thus be “unbalanced”, however due to rolling conditions, the dice will always roll random. If your DM is okay with you rolling chessex, you can roll handmade dice.</p>

<p>The difference is that we’re not making loaded dice - which is a completely different production process, also using special machinery like a hermetic chamber. But again, even loaded dice won’t ALWAYS roll to what you want based on environmental conditions, they are just more likely to roll something.
Personally I have recorded 1k rolls on my handmade dice and the % difference between the numbers that came up are within a .1% difference (ie. One dice rolled a 7 .1% more times than the lowest rolled number)</p>
